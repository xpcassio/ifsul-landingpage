# BASE PROJECT - REACT

I use this to start base project in React.

## What it's using?

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  For build and local development.

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  A utility-first CSS framework.

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
  An opinionated code formatter on save.

## What it's different from doing manually?

- Better **.gitignore**.
- Already installed **TailwindCSS** with Vite.
- Already installed **Eslint** rules.
- Removed mock files and folders.
- Add folder structure.
- Already installed **Prettier** and configured to work with Eslint.

## Initial configuration

1. Copy the folder
2. Change the project informations inside de following files:

- ./index.html
- ./package.json

3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
4. Remove git tracking with `rm -rf .git`
